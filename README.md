# MiniProductMVC

MiniProductMVC is a simple Node.js web application for managing a list of products. It provides a straightforward interface for viewing a list of products and adding new products to the list. This application is built using Express.js and uses EJS for rendering HTML pages. All the product data entered through the POST route are stored in a JSON file within a database folder.

## Features

- `GET /`: The root path that might contain a welcome message or overview of the application.
- `GET /products`: Displays the list of all products retrieved from the JSON database.
- `POST /add-products`: Allows users to add new product details which are then stored in the JSON file.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: A flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **Nodemon**: A utility that monitors for any changes in your source and automatically restarts your server for development convenience.
- **EJS**: Embedded JavaScript templates engine that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
- **Body-parser**: A middleware that is responsible for parsing the incoming request bodies in a middleware before handling it.
